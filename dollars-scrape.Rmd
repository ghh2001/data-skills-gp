# Downloading Data

This section downloads a single page. However, it can be modified to work across similar pages. 
```{r}
raw.data <- curl_download("https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151111.htm", "OES_dollars.txt")
raw.data <- readLines("https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151111.htm")
```

Since we're only interested in the first table, we'll cut everything else out.
```{r}
# Regex for all text between two table
"(?<=<table)(.*\n?)(?=</table>)"
```

```{r}
html.data <- readHTMLTable(truncated.data)
```
