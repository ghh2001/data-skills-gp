<hr><P><a href="oes_abo.htm">About May 2017 National, State, Metropolitan, and Nonmetropolitan Area Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates</a></P>
<p>These estimates are calculated with data collected from employers in all industry sectors, all metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, and all states and the District of Columbia.
The top employment and wage figures are provided above. The complete list is available in the <a href="/oes/tables.htm">downloadable XLS files</a>.</p>
<p>The percentile wage estimate is the value of a wage below which a certain percent of workers fall.
 The median wage is the 50th percentile wage estimate--50 percent of workers earn less than the median and 50 percent of workers earn more than the median.
 <a HREF="/oes/oes_perc.htm">More about percentile wages.</a></p>
<br>
<P id="(1)">(1) Estimates for detailed occupations do not sum to the totals because the totals include occupations not shown separately. Estimates do not include self-employed workers.</P>
<P id="(2)">(2) Annual wages have been calculated by multiplying the hourly mean wage by a &quot;year-round, full-time&quot; hours figure of 2,080 hours; 
for those occupations where there is not an hourly wage published, the annual wage has been directly calculated from the reported survey data.</P>
<P id="(3)">(3) The relative standard error (RSE) is a measure of the reliability of a survey statistic. The smaller the relative standard error, the more precise the estimate.</P>
<P id="(8)">(8) Estimate not released.</P>
<P id="(9)">(9) The location quotient is the ratio of the area concentration of occupational employment to the national average concentration.
A location quotient greater than one indicates the occupation has a higher share of employment than average, and a location quotient less than one indicates the occupation is less prevalent in the area than average.  </P>
